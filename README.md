### 3. Dialogue system
The dialogue feature in our game offers players a rich and immersive narrative experience by allowing them to engage with characters through dynamic conversations. Powered by ScriptableObject and seamlessly integrated into Unity Editor, our dialogue system provides a flexible and intuitive way to create, store, and edit dialogue data, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process. Our dialogue system supports event triggers, enabling developers to integrate dialogue sequences seamlessly with other game systems and events. By attaching event triggers to dialogue nodes, developers can trigger scripted events, animations, gameplay mechanics, and more.
