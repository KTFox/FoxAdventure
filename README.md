### 2. Shop
The shop feature in our game serves as a central hub where players can purchase/sell a variety of items, equipment, and resources to enhance their gameplay experience. With an intuitive and visually appealing interface, the shop provides players with access to a wide range of in-game goods and services.

Key features of our shop system include:
* **Item Catalog**: The shop offers a comprehensive catalog of weapon, armor, and ability. Players can browse through different categories and view detailed information about each item before making a purchase.
* **Currency System**: Our shop utilizes an in-game currency system, allowing players to earn currency through gameplay activities such as completing quests, defeating enemies, or selling items. Players can then use this currency to purchase items from the shop.
* **Special Offers and Discounts**: the shop may offer special discounts on select items that depend on player's level and specific shop.

### 3. Dialogue system
The dialogue feature in our game offers players a rich and immersive narrative experience by allowing them to engage with characters through dynamic conversations. Powered by ScriptableObject and seamlessly integrated into Unity Editor, our dialogue system provides a flexible and intuitive way to create, store, and edit dialogue data, ensuring a smooth and efficient development process. Our dialogue system supports event triggers, enabling developers to integrate dialogue sequences seamlessly with other game systems and events. By attaching event triggers to dialogue nodes, developers can trigger scripted events, animations, gameplay mechanics, and more.
