![Game logo](/ReadmePictures/GameLogo.png)

Welcome, this is the repository for my first 3D/RPG game made with Unity.

This project is built on **Unity 2022.3.8f1 LTS**

You can download and experience the game here ([itch.io](https://ktfox.itch.io/fox-adventure)).

## Features
### 1. Inventory
The inventory feature in our game serves as a crucial component of the player's journey, offering a seamless and intuitive way to manage and interact with items collected throughout the adventure. With a user-friendly interface, players can easily access their inventory, keeping track of various items, equipment, resources, and treasures acquired during gameplay.
